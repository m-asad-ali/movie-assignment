# Project Learnings

## Overview

I thoroughly enjoyed the process of building this application. The simplicity of the app, featuring a homepage with a search box and a list of movies. Clicking on a movie in the list navigates to a detailed page, and users can also perform searches within the list.

## Tech Stack

The technology stack I employed for this project included:

- **ReactJS:** Utilized for building the user interface and managing component-based architecture.
- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for implementing the application's logic and functionality.
- **Material UI:** Leveraged for designing responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.
- **React Router:** Facilitated seamless navigation within the application by handling route changes.
- **GraphQL:** Introduced for querying and fetching data from the server, providing a powerful and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs.

## Hiccups

While the development process was relatively smooth due to the simplicity of the app, I encountered a minor hurdle during the integration of GraphQL. Specifically, navigating through the documentation to understand the correct URL structure for API calls required some time and exploration.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building this application was an enjoyable experience that allowed me to apply and enhance my skills in a practical context. The project provided an opportunity to work with a modern tech stack which has GraphQL, and the challenges encountered served as valuable learning experiences. Looking forward, I am excited to tackle more complex projects and further deepen my expertise in the technologies used.
